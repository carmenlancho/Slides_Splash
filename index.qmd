## Sport Analytics: when sport meets data

-   The application of **data science, statistics, and technology** to
    analyze and improve athletic performance.
-   Gained momentum in the early 2000s with advances in tracking
    systems, video analysis, and machine learning.
-   Used in coaching, injury prevention, game strategy or talent
    identification.

<strong>Famous examples:</strong>

<ul>

<li><em>Moneyball</em></li>

<li>NBA -- player tracking, shot charts </li>

<li>Football -- GPS-based workload monitoring</li>

<li>Running, cycling -- biomechanical and physiological modeling</li>

## Swimming: precision, performance, and patterns

-   Swimming is **highly measurable**: distances, times, splits, stroke
    rates, turn times.
-   Small performance changes (e.g., 0.1s) can determine podiums ---
    **data granularity matters**.
-   Technology enables detailed monitoring:
    -   Wearable sensors
    -   Underwater cameras
    -   Biomechanical modeling
    -   Lactate and heart rate tracking

## Data

This work applies data science techniques to analyze **performance in competitive swimming**, using results from the **2024 World Swimming Championships (Budapest)** in a **25-meter pool**.

- Focus: race times, splits, strokes, and event-level metrics
- Context: elite international competition

**Data source:** [Omega Timing](https://www.omegatiming.com/sports-timing-live-results)  
Omega is the **official technical sponsor** of international swimming events and provides high-precision race data.

 ‚ü∂  Clustering

    
## Approach: Static vs dynamic
<div style="font-size: 80%;">
Datasets can be categorized based on their temporal availability:

- **Static data**: Fully available from the beginning of the study. These datasets can be explored, cleaned, and modeled comfortably.
- **Streaming data**: Arrives continuously in real time.

Traditional clustering algorithms assume full access to the entire dataset from the start.

Streaming data introduces an implicit **temporal dependency**: observations at time $t$ are often related to those at time $t-1$, creating an evolving structure. **Evolutionary clustering algorithms** process data sequentially and incorporate past information to update cluster structures in real time. 
</div>

# Static methodology

## Static methodology

 - Main goal: find groups according to different speed swimming patterns
 - Techniques: 
   - $k$-means
   - $k$-medoids
   - Agglomerative hierarchical clustering
   - Similarity measures: Euclidean distance and Dynamic Time Warping

# Dynamic methodology

## Dynamic methodology

-  Main goal: to detect race breaks

- Based on: *EvolveCluster: an evolutionary clustering algorithm for streaming data* [@nordahl2022evolvecluster]

- Adapted to swimming context: observations = swimmer gaps over time





## EvolveCluster: an evolutionary clustering algorithm
<div style="font-size: 70%;">

**Algorithm EvolveCluster [@nordahl2022evolvecluster]**

- $D$ is a continuous stream of data, segmented into time-based chunks $D_0, D_1, \ldots, D_t, t\rightarrow \infty$.

- $D_0$ is partitioned in $k$ clusters (via $k$-means): $C_{0}=\{C_{00},\dots, C_{0k}\}$.

- For each segment $D_t, t\neq0$, $k$-means is initialized using centroids from $C_{t-1}$

- Centroids of $C_{t-1}$ are removed and empty clusters are deleted.

- New centroides are calculated and the partition $C_t$ is refined:

  - Any cluster should be split into two? Apply $2$-means for each cluster with the two furthest points as initial centroids: $C'_t$
  
  - The two options of partitions are evaluated by a validation measure (e.g. Silhouette index SI): $\text{If } \text{SI}(C'_t) > \text{SI}(C_t)  + \tau \Rightarrow C_t \leftarrow C'_t$
  
</div>


## EvolveCluster

## EvolveCluster adapted
<div style="font-size: 70%;">
**Goal:** Detect race breaks

**Input:** Time gap from race leader

- Splits are evaluated **within each cluster**.
- Observations (swimmers) are sorted by gap to leader.
- A split occurs if two consecutive swimmers are **separated by more than** $\tau$

### Refinement strategy:

Let $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$ be consecutive swimmers in cluster $C_l$.  If $d(x_i, x_{i+1}) > \tau$, split the cluster at that point. 

$\tau$ can also be selected following a validation measure (SI, Dunn index, etc.)

### Advantages:
- $\tau$ is interpretable as the minimum meaningful gap between swimmers

# Conclusions and future work

## What we learned
<div style="font-size: 70%;">
- We explored both **static** and **dynamic** clustering approaches on competitive swimming data  
- From **splits**, we identified **strategic groupings** of swimmers based on how they paced their races  
- By analyzing **gap-to-leader** as streaming data, we captured **race dynamics** and key moments of separation  
- The combination of both views offers a richer understanding of **performance patterns**

Despite the limited data, our analysis provides:

- Tactical insights into pacing strategies
- Recommendations for swimmers and coaches
- A framework for interpretable and adaptable analytics
</div>


## Future Work

- Improve and expand the **interactive dashboard**
  - Enhanced visualizations
  - Real-time insights during races
- Explore and benchmark additional clustering algorithms
- Collaborate with coaches to translate patterns into training recommendations *(aspirational goal)*
